# TkinterML

### About
This is my small attempt to use the ML model to predict the scores of the students. I have used Multiple Linear Regression model to estimate the student's score based on the attributes like School, Previous Marks, Gender etc.

Running the project is easy (see the steps below) and some other technical details are inside the project.<br>
You can freely use my code and / or suggest me to improve mine.

Thanks,<br>

### Steps
**Step 1**: Just run `python mainpage.py` <br>
**Step 2**: Predict!
